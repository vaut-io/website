### Project scope

- Website type – it is more difficult to build a website that has additional functionality, such as an online store.
- Number of pages – the project’s timeline depends on how many pages the website has. Websites with many pages require more assets, wireframes, and user flow plans.
- Required features – some websites, like gaming sites, require additional features to function properly. Installing them requires extra work.
- Website maintenance – consider other work after the project is completed. Clients typically ask for maintenance, revision, and performance monitoring services.
- Project complexity – charge more for a new website. Conversely, your rate should be lower if you update an existing site or build a simple one using a template.
- Back-end tasks – in addition to designing and building their website, clients may ask you to handle its back end. This task may include managing the website’s hosting, domain, and plugins.

For dynamics tailwind properties in classes (maybe won't work if I want to map
an array...):

```astro
---
const bg = `bg-${color}-500`;
---
```

Draw animation (53 mins https://youtu.be/NniT0vKyn-E):

Custom counter ALSO there.

```astro
<script>
// Do this in Alpine
const path = document.querySelector('#path')
const pathLength = path.getTotalLength().toString()
path.style.strokeDashArray = pathLength
path.style.strokeDathOffset = pathLength
</script>

<style>
.trig {
  animation: draw 1s forwards 1s ease-out;
}
@keyframes draw {
  to {
  stroke-dashOffset: 0;
}
}
</style>
```
