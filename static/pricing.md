If we had to apply the bottom-up estimating technique to this, we’d further break down these stages into the actual tasks for each.

At the task level, here’s what this project could look like:

Planning

Plan IA
Sketch out a sitemap
Determine the technology stack
Understand the functionality to custom code
Understand the functionality to prove via plugins (with or without the customization)

Implementation

Build the website
Install and fine-tune plugins

Testing

Check overall functionality
Check for broken links
Check sitemap
Check for access
Check performance metrics

Review

Showing the site to the client
Do one round of revision
Submit for re-review

Client Training

Show the client the way around the site
Explain updates and ways of uploading content
